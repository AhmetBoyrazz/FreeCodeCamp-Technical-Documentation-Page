            <p>Skateboards are a great many things for different people. For some it is nothing more than a method of
                transportation. For others it can be a freeing experince, a way to push your limits, a passion.
                <p>Skateboarding is very technically diverse when accounting what the board is being used for. This
                    documentation page will document and discuss the technical aspects, as well the differences between
                    skateboards and longboards.</p>

            <p>Griptape on a skateboard is used to keep the riders feet locked on the skateboard. Griptape comes in a
                wide variety of grits.
                <h1>Skateboards</h1>
                <p>Skateboards griptape is in the range of 60-80 grit. This is because skateboards do not generally need
                    really coarse griptape and it tends to make tricks that involve flicking the board more difficult.
                    These grits are about balance between keeping the rider locked in and not interfering with the
                    riders overall board feel when flicking or sliding feet on the board.</p>

                <h1>Longboards</h1>
                <p>Longboard griptape is in the range of 30-40 grit. This is because longboards are more often used for
                    going downhill or day to day commuting. This makes it very easy for the rider to stay locked in
                    while performing slides and rolling at high speeds.</p>

            <p>The Deck is the heart of a setup. Without it, the setup is nothing. Both longboards and skateboards come
                in many different sizes and shapes. One thing to take notice of is that longboards having several
                different materials and complex concaves in the deck is more commmonplace.</p>
            <p class="subtitle">Concave</p>
            <p>Concave refers to where the board curves at the Tail, Nose, and Edges. The concave has many different
                benefits depending on the concaves design. Concaves overall use is to increase strength and help the
                rider have more control over the board.
                <h1>Skateboards - Concave</h1>
                <p>Skateboards tend to have three varying levels of concave. Steep, Medium, and Mellow. There are other
                    names for the levels of concave as well. Some brands also have their own proprietary concave design
                    like Zeros "Grave Digger Concave."</p>

                <h1>Longboards - Concave</h1>
                <p>Longboards have lots of different types of concave. This is because for longboarding there are lots
                    of diffent styles of skating that benefit from very differnet types of concave. For example "w
                    concave" might not be the most beneficial concave for someone that may be more into freestylee/dance
                    skating, as opposed to a rider that prefers freeride where "w concave" will help keep the rider
                    locked when kicking out slides.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">Shape</p>
                <p>Deck shapes come in many different forms. The shape of the deck can be designed for functionality or
                    can just be made a unique shape for aesthetic, a way for the rider to express themselves.</p>
                <h1>Skateboards - Shape</h1>
                <p>While skateboards come in many differnt shapes the designs tend to not very heavily modify the core
                    design of the board. Skateboards have found just about the right balance in design for what most
                    skateboarders are using the board for.</p>

                <h1>Longboards - Shape</h1>
                <p>Longboards have many different shapes that change the core design of the board, such as
                    "drop-through" boards. Drop through longboards have cut outs in the deck for the trucks to be
                    assembled through it. It "drops" the trucks through the board making is much lower to the ground
                    allowing it more stability when cruising at higher speeds. There are many different alternatives in
                    shape for different uses.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">Rocker</p>
                <p>Rocker is a feature typically found in longboards. Rocker is when the board bends downward in an arc
                    across the length of the board, sometimes to the point that the center of the board is below the top
                    of the trucks. This is really good for pushing as it brings the board lower to the ground. The
                    opposite of this is Camber</p>
                <p class="subtitle">Wheelbase</p>
                <p>Wheelbase refers to the distance between the front and back truck holes to the center of the deck. To
                    keep it simple, the wheelbase mainly affects the turning radius of your board. The larger the
                    wheelbase, the wider the turn. For longboards shorter wheelbases allow for more grip and easier kick
                    to slides while longer wheelbases give more drift control and a bit of a harder kick on slides.</p>

            <p>The trucks are the part of the skateboard that connects the deck to your wheels and bearings. It's main

            <h1>Skateboards - Trucks</h1>
            <p>Skateboards have a very standard design across multiple brands. This does not mean they are all the same
                though. A lot of brands have very great innovations ranging from changing the material to making them
                hollow. Trucks also have differnt widths to accomodate for varying board widths.</p>

            <h1>Longboards - Trucks</h1>
            <p>Longboard trucks have more design variety but not out of an aesthetic reason, but for functionality.
                Longboard trucks are usually split between cast (meaning the truck is made from a cast mold) and
                precision (meaning the truck is precision cut rather than made in a mold.) Some other design diffences
                are the angle the trucks sit, double kingpin, and reverse kingpin.</p>
